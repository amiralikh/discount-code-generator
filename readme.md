# Discount Code Generator Script

## Overview

This Go script is designed for **marketing teams** that require the ability to generate a large number of random discount codes quickly and efficiently. Whether you need to provide discount codes for a promotion, event, or sale, this tool simplifies the process, helping your team focus on more important tasks.

**Key Features:**
- Generate **random discount codes** in bulk.
- High-speed processing to handle large numbers of codes at once.
- Fully customizable code structure for flexibility.
- Efficient performance to support marketing campaigns at scale.

This script is optimized to meet the demands of modern marketing teams, ensuring you can generate a large batch of codes with minimal effort.

## Installation

To get started, follow these simple steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/amiralikh/discount-code-generator.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project folder:**

   ```bash
   cd discount-code-generator
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   Since this is a Go-based script, make sure you have Go installed. You can download Go from [here](https://go.dev/doc/install). After installing Go, you can run the following command to install necessary dependencies:

   ```bash
   go mod tidy
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the script:**

   Once you have everything set up, you can run the script directly from the terminal.

   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```

2. **Output:**

   After running the script, the generated discount codes result will be displayed in the terminal. You can also redirect the output to a file for further processing:

   ```bash
   go run main.go > discount_codes.txt
   ```

   This will create a text file called `discount_codes.txt` with the generated codes.

## Optimization and Further Improvements

While the script is designed to be fast and efficient, there is always room for improvement. If you have suggestions or want to contribute, please feel free to submit a **pull request**. Here are some areas where improvements can be made:

- **Concurrency:** If you're dealing with an extremely high volume of codes, we can explore multi-threading or concurrency to further speed up the process.
- **Customization:** We can add more options for customizing code patterns or integrating with external APIs.
- **Error Handling:** Additional error handling can be implemented to catch edge cases and prevent failures during execution.

If you have any ideas or need help optimizing this script further, please open an issue or create a pull request.
